Louis Jordan was found on his sailboat, which was listing and in bad shape, rescuer says .
He appears to be in good shape, physically and mentally . 
Greedy Search: Louis Jordan, 37, was found by a container ship hundreds of miles from land. He had been at sea for more than two months. His father says he was expecting his son to look different. "He's got a very strong constitution," his father said. 'He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,' he said of his appearance. 
Beam Search: Louis Jordan, 37, left Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. A storm capsized his boat and broke his mast, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again, the ship captain said. 
Top-K Sampling: Louis Jordan, 37, had been drifting on a sailboat for more than two months. He left Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean after a storm capsized his boat.

Ground Truth: Americans paid more for some fruits and vegetables last year because of the drought .
Tourists will now have to ask for a glass of water at a California restaurant .
Perhaps the only good thing is another "great" wine grape harvest last year . 
Greedy Search: California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables. The drought is affecting other states, too, as well. A strong dollar and drop in oil prices are helping farmers. But the drought could still affect food prices. It's a big reason why California is getting more wine. 
Beam Search: California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables. A strong dollar allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain. The 2014 wine grape harvest was a "third of a great decade," the Wine Institute says. 
Top-K Sampling: California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of fruits and nuts. A strong dollar allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere.

Ground Truth: Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard .
But where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom .
From China to Malaysia, journalists and bloggers have been jailed -- even killed . 
Greedy Search: Online activity has emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media in authoritarian countries. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, and some, like the arrest of a video blogger in Singapore, brings legal and financial pressure. The biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers.
