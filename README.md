Hello! Thank you for checking out pirate papers. DK please let me know if you want the homeworks removed from this public repo.

The project of interest is PIRATE Papers. The user should install the following packages in order of less likely to already be download to very likey:
PyMuPDF (this is fitz but install this instead)
concurrent.features (only if using the threading branch)
tkinter
requests
threading
math
sentence_transformers

The GUI.py will open the GUI and allow the user to input their search query. BEWARE: There massive loading times due to calls to the S2ORC API. If you have any needs message me on Slack or email me at zimm0398@umn.edu and I will be more than happy to help.
